# RDF-Molecular-Dynamics

I investigated a molecular dynamics method composed of xenon atoms.
Accepting this separation between atoms describes the Lennard-Jones potential
parameters kB = 226 K  and sigma = 3.95 Ã…. Develop a radial correlation function for the kilogram
atomic and temperature assessments.
